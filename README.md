# PolarstepsCompanion
A simple companion app for [Polarsteps](https://www.polarsteps.com/). Polarsteps is a great app for tracking your travel. During my travels I wished I could somehow add geolocation to photos taken with my old DSLR camera. This is where this app comes in. You can take your data exported from the Polarsteps app and use each DSLR photo's timestamp to calculate the location it was taken in. The app also supports additional functionality, such as shifting timestamps of your photos (if your DSLR's clock was offset).

## Here's how it works:
* First, select a directory with your photos:

* Then, select directory with your Polarsteps data:

* And voil√†! A geolocation of your photos is calculated. You can preview and save it.

This is in no way associated with the Polarsteps app and is intended for individual use only.
